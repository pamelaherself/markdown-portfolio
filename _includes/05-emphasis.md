1. I believe that it is difficult **to kill** an idea. Ideas are invisible and
contagious, and *they move fast*.

2. I believe that you can **set your own ideas** against ideas you dislike. That
you should be free to **argue**, *explain*, **clarify**, *debate*, **offend**, *insult*, **rage**,
*sing*, **exaggerate**, and *deny*.

3. I do not believe that ~~burning, murdering, exploding people, smashingtheir heads with rocks~~ (to let the bad ideas out), 
drowning them, or even defeating them will work to contain ideas you do not like. 
   1. Ideas spring up where you do not expect them, like weeds. 
   2. And they are as difficult to control.
